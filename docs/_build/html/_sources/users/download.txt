Download and Installation
=========================

Source code is freely available from `GitHub
<https://github.com/Timothy-W-Hilton/IOAPI_Pytools>`_.

The easiest way to install IOAPIPytools to your python environment is
to use `git <https://git-scm.com>`_ and `pip
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_.  There are two ways to do this.

install directly from GitHub
----------------------------

This will not make a local copy of the IOAPIPytools source code on
your machine::

  pip install git+https://github.com/Timothy-W-Hilton/IOAPI_Pytools.git

install locally from GitHub
---------------------------

Alternatively, you can make a local copy of the source code and
install to your python environment from there.

clone IOAPIPytools to a local directory::

  cd /some/local/directory
  git clone git@github.com:Timothy-W-Hilton/IOAPI_Pytools.git

And then install using pip::

  pip install /some/local/directory/IOAPI_Pytools
